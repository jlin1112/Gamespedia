<h3>IOS simulator version download link: url</h3>
  	-Unfortunately, without a Mac and an Apple developer account, I'm unable to build and test a distributable version of the app for real iOS devices, similar to Android. However, the demo video showcases the app running on an iOS device using Expo. Additionally, the iOS simulator version is available for download and installation on a Mac's iOS simulator. Feel free to download and try it out on a Mac's simulator!
